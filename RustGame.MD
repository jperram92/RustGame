✅ Project Idea: Rust-Powered Multiplayer Turn-Based Game Engine API
🔥 TL;DR
You build a Rust backend that:

Stores and manages game state (e.g. Tic Tac Toe, Battleship, Chess Lite)

Exposes RESTful endpoints to interact with the game

Saves state in a local database or even Supabase via REST

Is callable from your existing React/TS frontend

It’s fast, stateless (per request), and Rust makes it safe and scalable for more players or even AI expansion later.

🎮 Concept: Turn-Based Game Engine (Tic Tac Toe+)
Let’s use Tic Tac Toe as an MVP, then expand to Battleship, Connect Four, or Chess Lite.

🔧 Core Features:

Feature	Rust API Responsibility
Create new game	Generate UUID, initial game state
Make move	Validate move, update state, detect winner
Get game state	Return current board, whose turn, winner
Reset game	Start fresh, keep player IDs
Save to DB	Optionally sync to Supabase or SQLite
🦀 Rust Stack (Backend)
axum or actix-web → Web framework (elegant, async-ready)

serde → Serialize game state to JSON

sqlx or surrealdb → Optional DB

uuid → Game/session tracking

tokio → Async runtime

tower → Middleware for logging, error handling, CORS

📦 API Endpoints (RESTful)

Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/games	Create a new game
GET	/games/{id}	Fetch current game state
POST	/games/{id}/move	Submit a move {x, y, player}
POST	/games/{id}/reset	Restart the game
DELETE	/games/{id}	Delete the game (optional)
🔄 Frontend (React/TS)
Use Axios or Fetch to:

Create a game

Show the board using game state

Submit a move

Display turn info & winner

Use Supabase Auth to tag players

🧠 Why This is a Great Project
✅ Real-world architecture: API + Frontend

✅ Reusable logic: Game engines are logic-heavy, ideal for Rust

✅ Expandable: Add more games or even AI later

✅ Teaches you async, state, REST, testing, and game design

🧪 Bonus Expansions

Feature	Value
Add player auth (via Supabase JWT)	Secure turns by player
Add a leaderboard (Supabase DB)	Show high scores
Add AI player (Rust logic)	Optional difficulty levels
Add websocket support	Real-time move notifications
Add game replays	Save moves in sequence
🛠️ Setup Steps
Create Rust project:

bash
Copy
Edit
cargo new rust_game_api
Add dependencies: In Cargo.toml:

toml
Copy
Edit
[dependencies]
axum = "0.7"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
uuid = { version = "1", features = ["v4"] }
tower = "0.4"
Create basic server: Use axum to build a simple endpoint (I’ll scaffold this if you want).

Test with Postman or curl.

Connect React frontend via REST using your domain/localhost.

✅ Let’s Kickstart It
Would you like me to:

Scaffold the full Rust API backend for Tic Tac Toe?

Provide the React/TS component to interact with it?

Add Supabase support for storage/auth?
