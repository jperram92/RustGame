# Building a Turn-Based Game Engine in Rust - Learning Path

## 1. Project Architecture Overview

### System Components
```ascii
+------------------+     +------------------+     +-------------------+
|   HTTP Layer     |     |   Game Engine    |     |   Data Layer      |
| (Axum/REST API)  | --> | (Core Logic)     | --> | (State/Storage)   |
+------------------+     +------------------+     +-------------------+
        ↑                        ↑                         ↑
        |                        |                         |
    REST Calls              Game Rules              Persistence
```

### Component Responsibilities

1. **HTTP Layer (API Interface)**
   - Handle incoming HTTP requests
   - Route requests to appropriate handlers
   - Manage request/response serialization
   - Handle CORS and middleware
   - Manage authentication (future)

2. **Game Engine (Core Logic)**
   - Game state management
   - Move validation
   - Win condition checking
   - Turn management
   - Game rules enforcement

3. **Data Layer**
   - Game state persistence
   - Player data storage
   - Game history tracking
   - Database interactions

## 3. Key Rust Concepts We'll Learn

1. **Ownership and Borrowing**
   - How Rust manages memory
   - Why game state needs careful ownership handling
   - Sharing state between components safely

2. **Type System**
   - Custom types for game states
   - Enums for player turns and results
   - Implementing traits for game behaviors

3. **Error Handling**
   - Custom error types
   - Result and Option types
   - Proper error propagation

4. **Concurrency**
   - Async/await patterns
   - Safe state sharing between requests
   - Tokio runtime usage

## 4. Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Basic project setup
- Core game state structures
- Simple board representation
- Basic move validation

### Phase 2: Game Logic
- Complete game rules
- Win condition checking
- Turn management
- Game state transitions

### Phase 3: API Layer
- REST endpoint implementation
- Request/response handling
- Basic error handling
- JSON serialization

### Phase 4: Persistence
- Game state storage
- Game history tracking
- Database integration

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- Authentication
- Websocket support
- AI player implementation
- Game replay system

## 5. Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Game logic validation
   - Board state management
   - Move validation

2. **Integration Tests**
   - API endpoint testing
   - Game flow testing
   - Storage integration

3. **Property Tests**
   - Game state invariants
   - Board validity checks
   - Move sequence validation

## 6. Important Rust Considerations

1. **Memory Safety**
   - Game state must be thread-safe
   - Avoid memory leaks in long-running games
   - Proper cleanup of abandoned games

2. **Performance**
   - Efficient board state representation
   - Minimal cloning of game states
   - Optimal move validation algorithms

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful handling of invalid moves
   - Proper error propagation
   - Clear error messages for clients

## Next Steps

1. Begin with project setup and basic structures
2. Implement core game logic
3. Add API layer
4. Integrate persistence
5. Add advanced features
